# Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

### Objective
The goal of this task is to understand the components of a strong password and to use online tools to assess its security. This report documents the process, the password created, and the evaluation results.

### Step 1: Password Creation

To complete this task, I created a new, strong password. The principles I followed were:
* **Length:** The password is X characters long.
* **Character Variety:** It includes a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
* **Unpredictability:** It does not use common words, personal information, or simple keyboard patterns.

The password created for this exercise (for example): `My$tr0ngP@$$w0rd!23`
*(Note: This is a placeholder. You should describe your actual password without revealing it.)*

### Step 2: Password Strength Evaluation

I used the following online password strength checker:
* [passwordmeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com/)

*(You can choose another tool if you prefer. Just replace the link and name.)*

Below is a screenshot of the evaluation results:

### Step 3: Analysis of Results

Based on the tool's evaluation, my password was rated as **[High/Medium/Low]** strength. The factors that contributed to this score include:

* **Positive Factors:**
    * (e.g., "The length of the password significantly increased its strength.")
    * (e.g., "The use of a variety of character types added complexity.")
    * (e.g., "The inclusion of special characters was a key contributor.")
* **Negative Factors (if any):**
    * (e.g., "I could have made it longer to achieve a higher score.")
    * (e.g., "The tool noted a slightly predictable pattern in a small part of the password.")
